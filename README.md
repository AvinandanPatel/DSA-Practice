In this Project, We will Solve different DSA Problems. Starting from Basic to Advance level from LeetCode.

# Table of Contents
1. Array
2. Matrix
3. String

## 1. Array
- It is used as a list in Python
- subarray :
- subsequence :
- Several important algorithms are designed specifically for arrays, addressing common tasks like searching for an element, sorting the array in a specific order, or performing various transformations on the array’s elements.
Following are some commonly used algorithms specifically for arrays:<br>

      1. Sliding Window
      2. 2/3/4 pointers
      3. The Kadane’s Algorithm
      4. Dutch’s National Flag algorithm
      5. Prefix and Suffix Sum (2 sum/ 3 sum)
      6. Searching(Linear, Binary)
      7. Sorting
- **NOTE:** Should know
  
      1. How to Traverse a list from the right end, left end
      2. How to traverse by 2 differences from both ends
      3. Finding max and min in one pass
      4. Finding 2nd max along with max in one pass
